Hello Joey.
Hi Tata.
What do you think of Donald J. Trump is tariffs?
I don’t like it much because all tariffs are barriers, but it might help America.
What do you think?
I think although Trump is idea of recovering America is industrial capabilities is good, the reality is that American workers had long lost their industrial skills. By the way, are you still in touch with Ria?
No.
Well, anyways, I’m pretty sure she is in Japan right now.
Yes, with a new boyfriend.
Do you like Iolani?
Iolani is fine. Classes are a bit stressful though, especially since I slacked off a bunch during the third quarter.
You Chinese are putting too much pressure on yourself.
Well, it is not only the Chinese. I think it is just Iolani culture.
Studying is a mindset.
You can be what you want to be, just envision yourself in it.
And I think the background music is greatly enhancing your moral lesson experience.
Same?
Maybe.
How is Iolani Fair?
Iolani Fair is cool, but working shifts from 5 A.M. to 5 P.M. is kind of difficult.
I like Fair; I had a lot of fun.
Did you like the mochisadas?
Yeah, I think they’re better than last year is malasadas. Probably because I like mochi a lot. And because I worked there, I got free food.
Were they better than the malasadas from last year?
I bought two custard and two without. Did you have any of the custard ones?
I did. It was good.
That is good to know.
How do you think it compares to Punahou Carnival?
Well, the food is better, and because I know more people here, it is fun.
That makes sense, though Punahou is campus is way bigger.
Yeah, it is. It depends on who I hang out with. They are both fun. It is about the people, not the location.
True. Last time when you went to Punahou Carnival, did you go with friends?
I went with a freshman girl.
Interesting. That Italian dorm girl?
No.
No.
No.
Interesting. How did you meet that girl?
Photography class.
LOL.
Apparently, I am attractive and smart.
Interesting comment about yourself. So I’m assuming she—
I am though.
Type out your sentence, bro.
I’m assuming—
Well, anyway. How do you like your steak cooked?
Medium rare, or even more rare. I want it juicy.
I like medium rare too.
What would you do if a chef sucked out all the juice with a blender?
I didn’t get it.
My bad. I meant, would you still eat it if the chef accidentally made it well done?
I would tell them to redo it.
Fair enough.
Where is your favorite restaurant?
I don’t really have one. I love all.
Well, favorite cuisine?
Probably Japanese. It is fresh.
Yeah, me too. But there is a lot within the domain of Japanese cuisine. Tonkatsu?
More like sushi or sashimi. Or those expensive things.
Makes sense.
What are you planning to do in the summer this year?
Going to the East Coast and taking a trip with my senior friends.
I’m going to Chicago for three weeks. Between that and the end of school I still have one week though, so I’m not sure what to do.
Same. I go to Yale. I might just travel with my mom.
That is a great idea.
I applied to Chicago last year, but I didn’t want to go. I don’t really like it there.
Is it because of the weather, climate, or the school in general?
More like too many nerds there. No good.
LOL.
You’re definitely not inferring anything.
Definitely not.
So what colleges are you considering that are not, too nerdy?
Big party school.
But good, because I am too smart for them.
Okay Joey...
I’m imagining you would like USC in SoCal?
Yep, one of my favorites.
Good to know.
Do you think USC will offer good wagyu?
I don’t know, but I don’t really care.
It is the people. The college vibe.
That is deep.
Is it for the same reason that you decided to come to Iolani School?
Well, not really.
I don’t know. I just like Hawaii.
I see.
Well, I once heard from a student from Le Jardin Academy that Iolani School is the most not-Hawaii school.
Well, it is fine.
I like it here.
A lot of fun people.
I’m assuming you’ve been making great friends over here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Especially freshman girls, right?
No, I like all girls. I don’t discriminate.
Like you said before...
Well, that particular emphasis on the girl you went with to Punahou Carnival being a, freshman.
Because she is a freshman maybe?
It just happens to be.
Okay.
Do you think Indigo Biggins will graduate from this school?
Yeah, why not?
Because I don’t know—just for the sake of making this conversation sample longer.
Sure.
What do you think of alcohol and weed? Just curious. Which one is worse?
Obviously weed is worse, because first, it smells horrendous, and second—
Not really. It smells good. People have different opinions on this.
Well, if you were asking me, it is terrible. And of course, someone else may say something different.
I also think it brings lots of people to greater misery and hopelessness than if they hadn’t touched weed.
Nah.
People made their decisions, and people are happy.
As long as we are happy, that is all that matters.
Well, good for them, I guess. I just don’t think they really have a choice once they’re in the cycle of addiction.
Well, I don’t know—maybe.
How is life?
Life is been okay. I’ve been stressing way too hard on AP Chem.
Well, I never stress about academics. I guess I am too smart, too intelligent.
That is cool.
What is your favorite quote or sentence?
My favorite quote?
Like a philosophical sentence or something like that.
Um... that is a hard question.
Mine is, People change.
That is deep.
I like short quotes. They hit harder.
Yeah, like those one-liner ones that sound simple but mess with your brain the more you think about it.
Exactly. Like, Know thyself. What does that even mean?
It is Socrates, I think. Or maybe Plato? Same Greek guys.
They were probably sitting around just thinking all day.
Honestly, vibes. I wish I had that kind of time.
Instead we have APs and college apps and fairs and stress.
It never ends. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I just stopped trying for a week.
Probably spontaneous combustion.
LOL. Or maybe I’d finally catch up on sleep.
Do you even sleep these days?
Barely. Like 4-5 hours.
That is terrible. You need like 8 minimum.
You sound like my mom.
She is right though. Gotta protect the brain cells.
I think I already lost most of them in the third quarter.
Third quarter was brutal.
It really was. I don't know what happened.
I think the motivation just dropped.
Same. Like, I knew I had to work but couldn’t get myself to start.
And once you fall behind, it is so hard to catch up.
Yeah, like digging out of a hole with a spoon.
That is a sad metaphor.
But accurate.
So are you going to try to fix it in the fourth quarter?
I’m trying. I made a to-do list.
Nice. I tried that too but I ended up just decorating it.
Mood. I spent 20 minutes choosing a font.
Productivity through aesthetic.
That should be a class.
Honestly, I’d take it over AP Chem.
Same. Why is AP Chem so much pain?
Because it is not just memorization. It is like, logic puzzles with math and science and sadness.
And labs that never work.
Our last titration lab was a disaster.
Same. Ours turned pink and then purple and then back to clear.
That is not supposed to happen, right?
Nope. But the teacher said, good effort.
At least you got that. We got a, re-do this.
Rough.
Everything is rough these days.
At least there is summer coming up.
True. Just gotta make it a few more weeks.
Then freedom.
Or more stress, depending on what you signed up for.
Fair. But at least it is a different kind of stress.
Like choosing where to eat instead of writing DBQs.
Exactly. I’d rather stress over dinner than over derivatives.
Do you know where you’re going for your East Coast trip yet?
Not fully. Probably New York, maybe Boston.
Ooh, both good cities.
I’ve never been to either, so I’m excited.
You’ll love New York. Just wear comfortable shoes.
Why, is there a lot of walking?
It is basically a cardio workout every day.
Got it. I’ll pack sneakers.
And maybe a portable charger. Your phone is gonna die from taking photos.
Good tip. I’ll keep that in mind.
Do you like city trips more or nature trips?
City, definitely. I need food options.
Same. I like forests for 20 minutes and then I miss sushi.
Exactly. I need convenience.
Although I wouldn’t mind a cabin if it had Wi-Fi.
And a kitchen. And AC.
So basically a house.
Yeah but in the woods.
Glamping.
Totally down for glamping.
We should do that sometime.
That would be fun. After college apps maybe.
Let is survive that first.
One day at a time.
One assignment at a time.
One cup of coffee at a time.
One breakdown at a time.
LOL. But actually.
We’ll make it though.
Yeah. People change.
Full circle. I respect that.
I try. Sometimes I write down stuff like that in my notes app.
Same. I have a folder called, random thoughts at midnight.
I have one called, things to say in a movie.
That sounds amazing. What is in there?
Mostly dramatic one-liners. Like, I never meant to stay, but I could not leave.
Wow. That sounds like the start of a breakup scene.
Yeah, or the end of a season finale.
You should be a writer.
Nah, I just like words.
That is kind of what a writer is though.
Maybe. I guess I do think about stories a lot.
Me too. Like, if someone watched my life as a show, what would the plot be?
Probably a slow build with way too many monologues.
And not enough action.
Unless you count pulling all-nighters as action.
True. Or running to class after the bell.
That is basically a chase scene.
Do you think we are main characters?
Maybe. Or maybe everyone is the main character in their own story.
That is kind of deep.
It helps me not compare myself to others as much.
That is healthy. I wish I did that more.
It takes practice. I still fall into it.
Especially with college stuff.
Yeah. Everyone is doing something and it makes me feel like I am behind.
But behind what, you know? There is no fixed schedule.
That is true, but it does not feel that way sometimes.
No one really talks about how random success is.
Or how messy the process is.
We only see the highlights.
Exactly. The accepted posts, the trophies, the perfect scores.
But not the nights spent crying or doubting.
I think that is why honest conversations matter.
This feels like one of them.
It does. Kind of rare, actually.
Yeah. Most people just say, I’m fine and move on.
Because it is easier.
But not better.
Agreed. I want to get better at saying real things.
Same. I want to ask people real questions too.
Like, What are you afraid of?
Or, When did you last feel proud of yourself?
That one is hard. I do not know the answer.
Me neither. But I want to figure it out.
Do you think people our age think like this often?
Probably more than they admit.
I wonder why we are scared to say it out loud.
Maybe because people might not take us seriously.
But we are serious.
Yeah, and thoughtful too.
It just gets buried under test scores and grades.
And trying to seem chill.
Which is so much work.
It really is. Being chill is exhausting.
I feel like we are always pretending a little.
Trying to be cool, confident, funny.
But deep down, we are all kind of unsure.
Kind of lost.
Kind of hoping someone else feels the same.
Maybe that is what connection is.
Realizing you are not the only one faking it.
I like that. I might write that in my notes app.
Do it. You have a good way with words.
Thanks. That means a lot.
I mean it. You have thoughts that matter.
So do you. That is why this conversation is nice.
Yeah. We should do this more.
Definitely. It is kind of rare to talk like this.
It should not be.
No, but I guess we need the right space.
And the right people.
I think we found that today.
Yeah. This was real.
You want to go get something to eat?
Sure. I could use a break.
Do you want sushi again?
Always. I never get tired of it.
Let us go. We earned it.
Yeah, we did.
