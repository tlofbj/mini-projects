Hello Joey
Hi Tata
What do you think of Donald J. Trumps tariffs?
I dont like it much because all tariffs are barriers, but it might help america.
What do you think?
I think although Trumps idea of recovering Americas industrial capabilities is good, the reality is that American workers had long lost their industrial skills. By the way, are you still in touch with Ria?
No
Well… Anyways… Im pretty sure shes in Japan right now.
Yes, with a new boyfriend
Do you like Iolani?
Iolani is fine. Classes are a bit stressful though especially since I slacked off a bunch during the third quarter.
You chinese are putting too much pressure on yourself
Well, its not only the Chinese, I think its just Iolani culture.
Studying is a mindset.
You can be what you want to be, just envisioning yourself in it.
And I think the background music is greatly enhancing your moral lesson experience.
Same??
Maybe
How is Iolani fair?
Iolani fair is cool but working shifts from 5A to 5P is kind of difficult. 
I like fair, i had a lot of fun. 
Did you like the mochisadas?
Yeah i think its better than last years malasadas. Probably because i like mochi a lot. And cuz i worked there, i got free food. 
Were they better than the malasadas from last year?
I bought two custard and two without, did you have any of the custard ones?
I did, it was good. 
Thats good to know.
How do you think it compares to Punahou Carnival?
Well the food is better, and cuz i know more people here. Its fun. 
That makes sense though Punahous campus is way bigger.
Yeah it is. It depends on who I hang out with. They are both fun. Its about the people, not the location. 
True. Last time when you went to Punahou Carnival, did you go with friends?
I went with a freshman girl. 
Interesting…That italian dorm girl?
NO
NO
NO
Interesting. How did you meet that girl?
Photography class.
LOL!
Apparently I am attractive and smart.


Interesting comment about yourself… So Im assuming she…
I am tho.
Type out your sentence bruh.
Im assuming…
Well anyways. How do you like your steak cooked?
Medium rare or even more rare. I want it juicy. 
I like medium-rare too. 
What will you do if a chef sucks out all the juice with a blender?
?? I didnt get it. 
It is your bad/.
My bad. I meant would you still eat it if the chef accidentally made it well-done?
I would tell them to redo it.
Fair enough.
Wheres your favorite restaurant?
I dont really have one. I love all. 
Well favorite cuisine?
Probably japanese? Its fresh
Yea me too. But theres a lot within the domain of Japanese cuisine? Tonkatsu?
More like sushi or sashimi. Or those expensive stuff  
Makes sense. 
What are you planning to do in the summer this year?
Going east coast and trip with my senior friends.  
Im going to Chicago for three weeks. Between that and the end of school I still have one week though so Im not sure what to do.
Same, I go yale. I might just travel with my mom. 
Thats a great idea!
I apply chicago last year. But i didnt want to go. I dont really like there. 
Is it because of the weather, climate, or the school in general?
More like too many nerds there, no good.
LOL…
Youre definitely not inferring anything.
Definitely not
So what colleges are you considering that are not “too nerdy”?
Big party school.
But good, cuz i am too smart for them
Okay Joey…
Im imagining you would like USC in socal?
Yep, one of my favorites
Good to know.
Do you think USC will offer good Wagyu?
?? idk, but i dont really care
Its the people. The college vibe
Thats deeeep.
Is it for the same reason that you decided to come to Iolani School?
Well not really
I dont know here, i just like hawaii. 
I see…
Well I once heard from a student from Le Jardin Academy that Iolani School is the most not-Hawaii schools.
Well its fine.
I like it here. 
A lot of fun people.
Im assuming youve been making great friends over here.
Yeah yeah yeah, 
Especially freshman girls, right?
?
NO, I like all girls. I dont discriminate. 
Like you said before…
Well that particular emphasis on the girl you went with to Punahou Carnival being “freshman”
Because she is a freshman maybe??
It just happens to be
Ok
Do you think Indigo Biggins will graduate from this school?
Yeah why not
Because idk for the sake of making this conversation sample longer…
Sure
What do you think of alcohol and weed? Just curious. WHich one is worse?
Obviously weed is worse, because first, it smells horrendous, and second
Not really, it smells good. People have different opinions on this
Well if you were asking me, its terrible. And of course, someone else may say something different.
I also think it brings lots of people to greater misery and hopelessness than if they hadnt touched weeds.
NAHHHHHH
People made their decisions and people are happy.
As long as we happy, thats all it matters/
Well good for them, I guess, I just dont think they really have a choice once theyre in the cycle of addiction.
Well idk maybe
Hows life
Lifes been okay. Ive been stressing way too hard on AP Chem.
Well i never stress about academics, i guess i am too smart too intelligent
Thats cool.
Whats your favorite quote or sentence
My favorite quote? 
Like a philosophical sentence or something like that 
Um…thats a hard question…
Mine is “PEOPLE CHANGE”
THats deep…
